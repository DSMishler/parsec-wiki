== THE INFORMATION ON THIS PAGE IS NOW OBSOLETE. ==

The automatic conversion from affine loops to JDF has been deprecated (the **Q2J tool has been removed** from the PaRSEC project).

As an alternative, you can:

# Write a PTG representation of the algorithm in a JDF file directly.
# Use the DTD DSL to express the algorithm as affine loops in the inspector-executor model.

== How to Write a PaRSEC-Enabled Operation by using the PaRSEC Compiler (i.e., Q2J) ==

See [[understanding|Understanding the Compilation process]] to get a big picture. 

If you didn't compile the compiler yet (it is an optional step, with additional tools dependences), see Compiling the PaRSEC Compiler below.

==== Now What? ====

You should have a look at the generated JDF, maybe tune it, to add priorities, or change the data affinity. And then, proceed to the translation of the JDF into a C file, and a parsec opaque object. See the [[writejdf|Calling the JDF Translator]] section of How to Write a PaRSEC-Enabled Operation by editing the JDF file directly.
