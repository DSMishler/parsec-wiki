== How to Write a DAGuE-Enabled Operation by using the DAGuE Compiler ==

See [[understanding|Understanding the Compilation process]] to get a big picture. 

If you didn't compile the compiler yet (it is an optional step, with additional tools dependences), see Compiling the DAGuE Compiler below.

==== Now What? ====

You should have a look at the generated JDF, maybe tune it, to add priorities, or change the data affinity. And then, proceed to the translation of the JDF into a C file, and a dague opaque object. See the [[writejdf|Calling the JDF Translator]] section of How to Write a DAGuE-Enabled Operation by editing the JDF file directly.
