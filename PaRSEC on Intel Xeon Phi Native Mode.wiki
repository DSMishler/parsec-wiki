Running PaRSEC on Intel Xeon Phi is almost the same as [[https://bitbucket.org/bosilca/dplasma/wiki/compileandrun |running on other platforms]]. But there are some differences in the following sections:

== Install required softwares ==

To compile PaRSEC/DPLASMA in Intel Xeon Phi,you will need the following software of Intel Xeon Phi version:
* a BLAS library excitable on Intel Xeon Phi, usually is MKL.
* [[http://icl.cs.utk.edu/plasma/software/index.html |PLASMA]]. To get a Intel Xeon Phi version, please use x86_64-k1om-linux-gcc or icc with flags -mmic as C compiler, and x86_64-k1om-linux-gfortran or ifort with flags -mmic as Fortran compiler (x86_64-k1om-linux-gcc and x86_64-k1om-linux-gfortran are usually in {{{/usr/linux-k1om-4.7/bin}}} of your system) . Since PLASMA requires LAPACK and LAPACKE, make sure you LAPACK and LAPACKE are also compiled with the above compilers.

== Configuring and compiling PaRSEC for Intel Xeon Phi == 

**PaRSEC is able to use cross platform compilation, so compiling is always done in CPU, then executable program is copied to Intel Xeon Phi and run**
First, update to the branch native-mic-all-about-data. This is a branch especially for Intel Xeon Phi, inherited from all-about-data. There is an example invocation of cmake {{{contrib/platforms/config.mic}}}. Please start from this file and tweak it for your system. The same as compiling PLASMA, set compilers as follows:
{{{
CC=${CC:="icc -mmic"}
CXX=${CXX:="icpc -mmic"}
FC=${FC:="ifort -mmic"}
}}}
or
{{{
CC=${CC:="x86_64-k1om-linux-gcc"}
CXX=${CXX:="x86_64-k1om-linux-g++"}
FC=${FC:="x86_64-k1om-linux-gfortran"}
}}}
