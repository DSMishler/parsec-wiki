While running your DAGuE-based application, you may be interested in measuring hardware performance information to identify potential improvements to your code or to gather some benchmarks to assess your program's performance.  Within PaRSEC, there is a PINS module that utilizes the Performance Application Programming Interface (PAPI) to do just that.  PAPI is a great tool for getting hardware counter information during a program's execution and incurs minimal overhead.

In order to use this feature you must install PAPI, which can be found [[http://icl.eecs.utk.edu/papi/|here]], and you need to set the following CMAKE parameters:

 * DAGUE_PROF_TRACE=ON
 * PINS_ENABLE=ON
 * PAPI_INCLUDE_DIR=[path/to/papi/include]
 ** Note: The brackets are not included in the actual input.  A sample path would look like: /opt/include/
 * PAPI_LIBRARY=[/path/to/papi/lib/libpapi.a]
 ** Note: The brackets are not included in the actual input.  A sample path would look like: /opt/lib/libpapi.a or /opt/lib/libpapi.so depending on whether you want to link papi statically or dynamically.

Once all of these things have been set, you must specify which PAPI events you would like to monitor and under what scheme you would like them to be monitored.  To do this, go to your home directory and create a .dague directory like so:
{{{
#!bash
cd ~
mkdir .dague
}}}
